# Two-Stage-Robust-Optimization

This folked project is my personal replication of 

>"Zeng B, Zhao L. Solving two-stage robust optimization problems using a column-and-constraint generation method[J]. Operations Research Letters, 2013, 41(5): 457-461."

Two stage robust optimization using a column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;CG) method and Benders Decomposition.
This is an example code for the classical C&CG algorithm for two stage robust optimization, which is programmed by Python and solved by Gurobi solver.
